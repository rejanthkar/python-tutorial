Create a python file called assignment_1.py
-------------------------------------------

Write a program that will do the follow:
  - Prompt the user for their first name
      We have not learned this yet so here is the syntax
      name = input('What is your first name? ')
  - Prompt the user for the year that they were born
      We have not learned this yet so here is the syntax
      year = input('What year were you born? ')
  - From the name that you received from the input, we will figure out a username.
      username should be all lowercase and characters seperated by underscores.
  - From the year that was given, you will need to figure out their age

Program output should look similar to this:
-------------------------------------------
What is your first name? Dean
What year were you born? 1974
Hello Dean
Your username is d_e_a_n
You are 46 years old
