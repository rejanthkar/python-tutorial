## Notes

All notes from our class will be under the `notes` directory.

## Assignments

All assignments should be put under the `assignments` directory.  

Use the following naming convention for assignments:
`assignment_##.py`.
Example: `assignment_01.py`

I will push assignment instructions to this directory and will push example solutions under the `assignments\solutions` directory.
